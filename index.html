  <section id="abstract">
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Rising investments in the space industry has created greater demand for microelectronics usable in space vehicles. 
      However, designing microelectronic components is challenging, due to the harsh environment, along with stringent weight 
      and size constraints. This work focuses on designing a test protocol for an off-the-shelf component, the FTLX8574D3BCV 
      Multimode 10G SFP+ optical transceiver, to measure its susceptibility to ionizing radiation and charged particles. 
      Preliminary results suggest that combining high atomic-number materials (e.g., tungsten) to shield gamma radiation 
      with complementary layers containing boron for neutron moderation can reduce the total shielding mass, compared to 
      previously published shield designs. These findings offer an alternative solution for designing space-capable 
      transceivers to allow for high-speed data transmission at low bit error rates. By evaluating an off the shelf component 
      for space applications, this research presents a cost-effective option that may help reduce testing costs and accelerate 
      qualification time for new parts, which is greatly needed in the growing space industry today.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Shielding a commercial FTLX8574D3BCV 10G SFP+ optical transceiver for space requires balancing both radiation protection 
      and SWaP (size, weight, and power) constraints. In space, the device will be exposed to ionizing radiation from protons 
      (e.g. solar wind, SPEs), heavy ions (cosmic rays), and high-energy photons (gamma rays). Below, we explore lightweight, 
      compact shielding solutions considering mechanical and thermal limitations as well as identify materials (and combinations) 
      that efficiently attenuate these radiation types. We also compare shielding candidates against a baseline of 2 mm aluminum 
      (Al), which is known to be insufficient against high energy protons. We modeled each candidate using TRIM (Transport of Ions 
      in Matter), and have provided the results of such research below.
    </p>

  <!-- Baseline Modeling Procedure -->
  <section id="baseline-modeling">
    <h2>Baseline Modeling Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Figure one, initial dimensions of FTLX8574D3BCV 10G SFP+</strong><br>
      <em>[Image placeholder – Insert diagram of transceiver here]</em><br><br>
      Source: <em>Digikey Datasheet FTLX8574D3BCV.pdf</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      From this diagram, we identified three dimensions of significance: 56.50 mm (length), 13.70 mm (width), and 8.50 mm (height). 
      My modeling approach focuses on radiation penetration through the device’s vertical dimension (8.5 mm). Although we went 
      through multiple iterations, described below is our most recent baseline modeling of the transceiver. The approximate 
      internal layering is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Top Shell (Upper metal housing)</strong> – 2 mm of Aluminum (2.7 g/cm³)</li>
      <li><strong>Upper Internal Support</strong> – 1 mm of Polycarbonate</li>
      <li><strong>Microcontroller Memory Chip</strong> – 0.3 mm of Silicon</li>
      <li><strong>PCB Stack Up</strong> – 1.6 mm of composite FR4</li>
      <li><strong>Lower Internal Support</strong> – 1 mm of Polycarbonate</li>
      <li><strong>Bottom Metal Housing</strong> – 2 mm of Aluminum</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Notes on the incidence model: This leaves about 0.6 mm unaccounted for, possibly an air gap or a slight misestimation 
      in approximate thicknesses.

  <!-- Mechanical & Thermal Constraints -->
  <section id="mechanical-thermal-constraints">
    <h2>Mechanical and Thermal Constraints Identified for Shielding Materials</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Weight Constraints:</strong> The transceiver has a specific cross-section, and thick shielding drastically 
      increases mass. We aim for the minimal required thickness to reduce weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Thermal Constraints:</strong> The FTLX8574D3BCV may dissipate ~1 W of heat. Overly insulating materials (e.g., 
      some plastics) can cause overheating, so partial metal surfaces or thermally conductive layers can be important.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Structural Considerations:</strong> Polymers like pure polyethylene can outgas in space. Often, they require 
      an encapsulating metallic foil for barrier protection and rigidity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Primary Shielding Strategy -->
  <section id="primary-shielding-strategy">
    <h2>Primary Shielding Strategy (“The Graded-Z Approach”)</h2>
    <p>
      This research follows a graded-Z strategy, combining high atomic-number (Z) materials (e.g., tungsten, tantalum) 
      with hydrogenous, low-Z materials (e.g., polyethylene). The high-Z layer absorbs and scatters gamma rays and electrons, 
      while the low-Z layer further moderates and absorbs secondary radiation (like neutrons). NASA has recognized these 
      multi-layer approaches as effective in mitigating secondary particle generation and penetration.
    </p>
    <p>
      By layering tungsten or tantalum foil between polymer sheets (possibly boron-doped), we reduce overall thickness 
      compared to using a single thick shield of aluminum or steel. This multi-layer method is intended to limit secondary 
      radiation cascades and achieve high overall attenuation per unit mass.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Shielding Candidates -->
  <section id="shielding-candidates">
    <h2>Shielding Candidates</h2>

      photon penetration for energies up to 50 MeV.

  <!-- Overall Testing Procedure -->
  <section id="overall-testing-procedure">
    <h2>Overall Testing Procedure For All Models</h2>
    <p>
      Each candidate design was tested in TRIM (Transport of Ions in Matter) simulations, assuming normal incidence of 
      charged particles (protons, electrons) at various energies (5 MeV, 10 MeV, 50 MeV). The thickness and material 
      composition were varied to evaluate how effectively the stack attenuates or stops the beam. In future hardware 
      tests, we would expose an actual transceiver, plus any chosen shield design, to gamma, proton, and possibly neutron 
      sources, measuring bit error rate (BER) and device functionality at each radiation dose. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This step ensures that real-world usage matches modeling predictions, providing confidence in the part’s reliability 
      for space missions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Mathematical Justification -->
  <section id="mathematical-justification">
    <h2>Mathematical Justification for Optimal Width</h2>
    <p>
      Ideally, the optimal shield thickness is derived by balancing linear attenuation coefficients (for gamma) 
      and nuclear interaction cross-sections (for protons/neutrons). A simplified approach uses the exponential 
      attenuation law 
      (<em>I = I<sub>0</sub> e<sup>-&mu;x</sup></em> for photons) and stopping power data for charged particles 
      to find the minimal material thickness needed to reduce flux below mission limits.

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      In conclusion, multi-layer “graded-Z” shielding solutions combining high-Z and low-Z materials show promise in 
      protecting an off-the-shelf 10G optical transceiver from ionizing radiation. Modern references suggest that 
      tungsten, tantalum, or other high-Z foils coupled with hydrogenous layers (HDPE, boron-doped polyethylene, 
      silicone composites) can outperform single-material aluminum shields. The TRIM-based modeling and eventual 
      real-world testing will help finalize a design that balances SWaP constraints, thermal performance, and 
      radiation hardness, with the aim of accelerating qualification of commercial parts for space.
