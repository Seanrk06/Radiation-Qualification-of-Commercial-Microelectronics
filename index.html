  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>
    Rising investments in the space industry has created greater demand for microelectronics usable in space vehicles. 
    However, designing microelectronic components is challenging, due to the harsh environment, along with stringent 
    weight and size constraints. This work focuses on designing a test protocol for an off-the-shelf component, 
    the FTLX8574D3BCV Multimode 10G SFP+ optical transceiver, to measure its susceptibility to ionizing radiation 
    and charged particles. Preliminary results suggest that combining high atomic-number materials (e.g., tungsten) 
    to shield gamma radiation with complementary layers containing boron for neutron moderation can reduce the total 
    shielding mass, compared to previously published shield designs. These findings offer an alternative solution 
    for designing space-capable transceivers to allow for high-speed data transmission at low bit error rates. 
    By evaluating an off the shelf component for space applications, this research presents a cost-effective option 
    that may help reduce testing costs and accelerate qualification time for new parts, which is greatly needed 
    in the growing space industry today.
  </p>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    All modern digital communication relies on the transmission of data as a series of ones and zeros. These binary 
    signals are interpreted for various cases from kitchen appliances to rocket systems. Engineers have historically 
    relied on copper wiring to communicate these signals. However, in the harsh environment of space, ionizing 
    radiation from protons, heavy ions, and high energy photons [3] can affect the integrity of copper wiring. 
    This degradation may lead to potential failures in critical systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    A new and promising approach lies in the field of photonics in which light is used as the medium for relaying 
    data instead of electrical currents. Optical transmission can reduce the weight, and can be more robust against 
    certain types of radiation acting as an alternative. The FTLX8574D3BCV Multimode 10G SFP+ optical transceiver 
    is one example of a photonic device. It converts electrical signals into optical signals and vice versa which 
    allows for high speed data transmission, critical for space applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    We used Transport of Ions in Matter (TRIM) software to evaluate the performance of the FTLX8574D3BCV off-the-shelf 
    transceiver when exposed to charged particle radiation. Additionally, we identified multiple shielding candidates 
    that can improve the transceiver’s baseline performance. This approach helps us develop a robust qualification 
    method for future space missions.
  </p>

  <!-- Methodology -->
  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <!-- Baseline Modeling Procedure -->
  <h2>Baseline Modeling Procedure</h2>
  <p>
    From figure 1, we identified three dimensions of significance, highlighted below. The length of this transceiver 
    is 56.50 mm, the width is 13.70 mm, and the height is 8.50mm. From this, we build initial incidence testing 
    to demonstrate the effectiveness of our shielding candidates. Although we went through multiple iterations, 
    described below is the most recent baseline modeling of the transceiver. It’s important to note that all of the 
    below are approximations based on research done as we was unable to find a detailed manufacturing datasheet 
    for the internal components as they’re likely proprietary.
  </p>

  <p>
    From this diagram, we identified three key dimensions: the transceiver's length is 56.50 mm, its width is 13.70 mm, 
    and its height is 8.50 mm. We used these measurements to conduct initial incidence testing to evaluate the 
    effectiveness of our shielding candidates. Although we went through multiple iterations, it's important to note 
    that all the details mentioned are approximations.

  <ul>
    <li class="bolded-line">Top Shell (Upper Metal Housing) [2] - 2mm</li>
    <li class="bolded-line">Upper Internal Support - 1mm</li>
    <li class="bolded-line">Microcontroller Memory Chip - 0.3 mm</li>
    <li class="bolded-line">PCB StackUp - 1.6mm</li>
    <li class="bolded-line">Lower Internal Support - 1mm</li>
    <li class="bolded-line">Bottom Shell (Bottom Metal Housing) [2] - 2mm</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Notes on the incidence model:</strong> Approximately 0.6 mm remains unaccounted for, which may be due to the presence of an air gap or potential inaccuracies in the estimates.</p>

  <!-- Mechanical and Thermal Constraints -->
  <h2>Mechanical and Thermal Constraints Identified</h2>
  <p><strong>Weight Constraints:</strong> The transceiver has a specific cross-section that we need to consider when designing the shielding thickness. We want to maintain an equal thickness at most but hope to improve or lessen it to decrease the overall weight.</p>
  <p><strong>Thermal Constraints:</strong> The FTLX8574D3BCV dissipates up to ~1 W of heat. Enclosing it in an insulating material (like a plastic shield) could cause overheating. Shield designs should allow heat to escape. For example, using thermally conductive layers or ensuring some metal surface is exposed to radiate heat.</p>
  <p><strong>Structural Considerations:</strong> Pure polyethylene can outgas or be flammable [5], so in space, it often needs encapsulation. Encapsulating a polymer shield in a thin metallic foil (e.g., aluminum or steel) can provide a barrier against outgassing and also add rigidity.</p>

  <!-- Primary Shielding Strategy -->
  <h2>Primary Shielding Strategy</h2>
  <p><strong>“The Graded-Z Approach”</strong></p>
  <p>
    In this research we will take a graded Z approach to building shielding candidates for the transceiver. 
    Foundationally, we will use a dense high Z layer in conjunction with hydrogenous low-Z layers. The high-Z 
    material will absorb and scatter most gamma rays and electrons (and also slow down some fraction of protons), 
    while the low-Z material will thermalize and absorb the secondary radiation (like neutrons, lower-energy X-rays) 
    and further slow any charged particles that penetrated the first layer. By “layering” in this way, we can avoid 
    the buildup of dangerous secondary particles that a thick single-material shield would create. [6]
  </p>
  <p>
    We plan to demonstrate the efficacy of a high Z layer, between two lower Z materials. This low, high, low 
    layering method has been tested to lessen electron penetration by over 60% [6]. Additionally, we will model 
    neutron-absorbing dopants such as boron, lithium, or beryllium. NASA has identified these strategies as being 
    effective in mitigating secondary neutron effects from shielding.
  </p>
